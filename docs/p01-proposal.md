## Abstract
Our main question is, what characteristics are most common in people who have died with hypertension-related cardiovascular disease? To address the question, we will investigate datasets provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and we are concerned with the possible risk factors that people may unknowingly have. To address this concern, we plan to help identify common characteristics and bringing light to them so that individuals and healthcare professionals can keep the consideration in mind when dealing with these diseases.

## Key Words:
