## Introduction 

Heart disease has been the leading cause of death in the United States for decades. Despite knowing this, efforts made by the government and health centers to help mitigate the number of deaths have been underwhelming. Our project is designed to analyze the trends in death rates among people who suffer from cardiovascular diseases. Specifically, we are searching for common characteristics that will help to identify the inequalities people face within the healthcare research, diagnosis, and treatment stages for cardiovascular diseases. To do this, we will analyze death rates of cardiovascular disease datasets provided by the CDC. Our goal for this project is to create and provide accessible data visualizations and information to everyone in hopes that the people directly involved, such as policymakers and doctors, understand the possible inequitable conditions that affect people when it comes to cardiovascular disease and strive to make efforts that address those inequalities.

## Problem Domain:
 - Project framing
    - Our problem domain concerns physical health, specifically cardiovascular disease. The main question in mind on thinking about this problem are who is at risk of getting cardiovascular disease. How might the government seek to solve, or at least alleviate this issue? How might society need to change to lower death rates of cardiovascular disease?
- Human Values
  - As implied, human health and safety are human values that are within the problem domain. These values originate from trying to increase population lifespan in the US as cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of death. Another human value is income differences. According to the National Institutes of Health, there is a negative correlation of risk of heart disease to income levels; people of lower income and highly stressed people are at higher risk for getting having a cardiac arrest, along with other disease. One more potential human value is racial justice. It originates from the racial disparities in heart disease. According to Cleveland Clinic, race and ethnicity is not considered as a biological trait but rather social constructs, therefore disparities are rooted in social factors, known as social determinants of health, rather than genetic ones. One value tension with understanding the impact this disease has on the US is privacy and autonomy. Lifestyle changes like quiting smoking must be done to lower risk of heart disease, but forcing people to make these lifestyle changes may pose a problem to their autonomy.
- Direct Stakeholders
  - The direct stakeholders of this topic of interest are medical researchers and policy makers. Skills assumed in this dataset is being able to make summaries through coding, considering there is a lot of data in this. They would also need to know how the data is calculated for each row.
- Indirect stakeholders
  - One indirect stakeholder is potentially the general public. Most probably do not have the resources or technical expertise to use the data, but the people who do influence the medical field and policies they are a part of.
- Harms
  - One potential harm comes from ideas from the Challenging Power in Data Feminism. This is deficit narratives, which is to “reduce a group or culture to its “problems,” rather than portraying it with the strengths, creativity, and agency that people from those cultures possess.” In this scenario, by analyzing people by their death rates, it does not put into the spotlight their accomplishments.
- Benefits
  - One benefit of this data is for health professionals and policy makers to look at the this data and perhaps make changes for the better.

## Questions to seek
* **How has cardiovascular disease rates changes over time?** This is important because if we can see if the risks of death rates for cardiovascular disease has risen or gone down since 2011, we can try to figure out what may have caused that shift. For other health avenues like obesity and diabetes, rates have gone up because of the sugary foods in the market, what motivates this question is learning about what social trends may have contributed to cardiovascular disease.
* **How does race affect ones risk?** This is an important question because race is one of the main qualities about person socially. By looking and analyzing this data, we can determine which race is at a higher risk than others. What motivates this question is the constant examples in Data Feminism about racial inequity. As mentioned previously, researchers do not consider race to be as biological but rather as social constructs, so by having one race over the other getting a higher or lower death rates, that speaks to the social determinants of health.
* **Which counties have the highest death rate for cardiovascular disease and which ones have the lowest?** This is an important question because by researching about those counties, we might pull in reasons why that are ranked that way. What motivates this question is seeing if income levels correlate with higher or lower death rates.

## The Dataset
The dataset used for analysing in answering the questions reports the mortality rate of cardiovascular disease by year (2000-2019), county, age (either 34-64 years old or 65+ years old), race, and sex. Given that the CDC is a government agency, the data collection was most likely funded under US tax money. The US Congress authorizes a certain amount of money towards the CDC’s projects. According to the CDC website, they also accept private sector’s gifts, monetary or non-monetary, granted they pass their gift review for potential conflicts of interest. This is to ensure they maintain their scientific integrity. They also get money through the CDC Foundation, which was created by Congress to allow them to connect with private sectors in receiving gifts, granted they allow pass their gift review. The person likely to benefit from this data is the division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention themselves because their mission is to prevent those diseases. Other people who benefit from this might include the public, since this is public information, and specifically medical research to also look for ways to allevate this disease. 

## Key Findings
One key finding is that counties with high per capita income in counties might not always equate to a very low cardiovascular disease and stroke mortality rate. This might have to do with other specific variables that originally were not taken into account when thinking about the implications of having the highest and lowest cardiovascular disease and stroke mortality rates such as poverty rate (as opposed to just using the per capita income) and access to healthcare.

One key finding from the scatter plot is that only about 20 of the states have a lower median death rate in 2019 than in they did in 2000 for 65 plus year olds. This is important to note because this means, in the other 30 states, the rates have gone up over time due to some reason. Some key considerations to make are, "why are the rates going up in some areas and going down in others? Does that mean that states are actively trying to mitigate the deaths through some kind of reform or is it purely a coincidence? If there is some kind of reform, how do we apply that to all states?"
