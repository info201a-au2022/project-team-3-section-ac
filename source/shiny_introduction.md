## Introduction 

Heart disease has been the leading cause of death in the United States for decades. Despite knowing this, efforts made by the government and health centers to help mitigate the number of deaths have been underwhelming. Our project is designed to analyze the trends in death rates among people who suffer from cardiovascular diseases. Specifically, we are searching for common characteristics that will help to identify the inequalities people face within the healthcare research, diagnosis, and treatment stages for cardiovascular diseases. To do this, we will analyze death rates of cardiovascular disease datasets provided by the CDC. Our goal for this project is to create and provide accessible data visualizations and information to everyone in hopes that the people directly involved, such as policymakers and doctors, understand the possible inequitable conditions that affect people when it comes to cardiovascular disease and strive to make efforts that address those inequalities.

## Questions to seek
* **How has cardiovascular disease rates changes over time?** This is important because if we can see if the risks of death rates for cardiovascular disease has risen or gone down since 2011, we can try to figure out what may have caused that shift. For other health avenues like obesity and diabetes, rates have gone up because of the sugary foods in the market, what motivates this question is learning about what social trends may have contributed to cardiovascular disease.
* **How does race affect ones risk?** This is an important question because race is one of the main qualities about person socially. By looking and analyzing this data, we can determine which race is at a higher risk than others. What motivates this question is the constant examples in Data Feminism about racial inequity. As mentioned previously, researchers do not consider race to be as biological but rather as social constructs, so by having one race over the other getting a higher or lower death rates, that speaks to the social determinants of health.
* **Which counties have the highest death rate for cardiovascular disease and which ones have the lowest?** This is an important question because by researching about those counties, we might pull in reasons why that are ranked that way. What motivates this question is seeing if income levels correlate with higher or lower death rates.

## The Dataset
The dataset used for analysing in answering the questions reports the mortality rate of cardiovascular disease by year (2000-2019), county, age (either 34-64 years old or 65+ years old), race, and sex. Given that the CDC is a government agency, the data collection was most likely funded under US tax money. The US Congress authorizes a certain amount of money towards the CDC’s projects. According to the CDC website, they also accept private sector’s gifts, monetary or non-monetary, granted they pass their gift review for potential conflicts of interest. This is to ensure they maintain their scientific integrity. They also get money through the CDC Foundation, which was created by Congress to allow them to connect with private sectors in receiving gifts, granted they allow pass their gift review. The person likely to benefit from this data is the division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention themselves because their mission is to prevent those diseases. Other people who benefit from this might include the public, since this is public information, and specifically medical research to also look for ways to allevate this disease.

## Limitations
There may not be a lot of data imputed for certain years or counties. There may be other factors that may have caused a patient to die, not just cardiovascular disease, so that might skewer the data. There are also limitations to the grouping of nominal data. The race/ethnicity category does not consider groups who may be multiracial. Sex is divided up to male or female, so that does not consider if one is intersex. Furthermore, assuming sex refers to biological sex and not gender, transgender people’s experiences with health. To address this data, we will probably have to explicitly say what the limitations of categories are. As for the lack of data in some parts, we will not include those sections when summarizing data to analyze.
